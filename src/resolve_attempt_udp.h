 * An asynchronous resolve attempt for a single query targeted at a set of endpoints, via UDP.

 * A resolve attempt is an asynchronous operation submitted to an IO object, which amounts to a
 * sequence of query packet sends (one for each endpoint in the list) and a sequence of result
 * packet receives. The operation will wait for return packets until either a particular timeout has
 * been reached or until it is cancelled via the cancel() method.
