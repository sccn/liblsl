 *  - `LSL:streamfeed`: A request to receive streaming data on the connection. The server responds
 * with the shortinfo, two samples filled with a test pattern, followed by samples until the server
 * outlet goes out of existence.
 *  - `LSL:fullinfo`: A request for the stream_info served by this server.
 *  - `LSL:shortinfo`: A request for the stream_info served by this server if matching the provided
 * query string. The short version of the stream_info (empty `<desc>` element) is returned.
