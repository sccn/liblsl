/** Internal class of an inlet that's retrieving the data (the samples) of the inlet.

 * The actual communication runs in an internal background thread, while the public functions
 * (pull_sample_typed/untyped, open_stream, close_stream) wait for the thread to finish.
 * The public functions have an optional timeout after which they give up, while the background
 * thread continues to do its job (so the next public-function call may succeed within the timeout).
 * The background thread terminates only if the data_receiver is destroyed or the underlying
 * connection is lost or shut down.
